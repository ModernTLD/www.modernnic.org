title: What is ModernNIC?
permalink: /about/
---

ModernNIC is a new take on alternative DNS roots like OpenNIC, New Nations, FurNIC, etc. We operate under a highly inclusive policy, allowing anybody (experience provided) to operate their own TLD on our network (some restrictions apply, as detailed below). We currently 100% peer both ways with [OpenNIC](https://opennicproject.org), and we intend to keep it that way, their policies permitting. We fully hope all our TLDs will be respected and accessible on the OpenNIC network as well as our own servers.

### Current TLD Operators

The operational organizations listed here represent the Board of Directors of ModernNIC.

  - ModernTLD (founding member of ModernNIC) - Originally an OpenNIC registry for the `.o` domain, we moved to a peering agreement (ModernTLD <-> ModernNIC <-> OpenNIC) to expand the range of services and infrastructure we could provide. We operate all our domains under very similar policies as the OpenNIC project, in order to provide an open and democratic experience to everyone.
    - President and Operator: Jonah Aragon

### Potential TLD Operators

The following organizations have expressed interest in joining the operating ranks of ModernNIC.

  - CoreDomain: Operators of the `.core` domain. Currently in the Proposal stage.
    - President and Operator: Joseph Marsden
    - Sponsoring Group: TOWER Development

### Guidelines

##### Becoming a TLD Operator

To propose a TLD on our network, you must meet the following requirements and commitments:

  - Must be active in the ModernNIC community for at least 3 months.
  - Must be a "Verified Member" on our chat server.
  - Must have operated a Tier 2 server for ModernNIC for at least 3 months, or a Tier 2 server at OpenNIC for at least 6 months.
  - Must commit to funding and running their TLD indefinitely* (see below)

All TLD applications should first be discussed with any or all of the current TLD operators (listed above). They then proceed to a Proposal stage (detailed below).

*In an absolute worst case scenario where you need to cease TLD operations, you must be able to find a substitute to take control of your namespace(s)*

##### Proposals

Proposals should be well written and detailed. The goals should be clear and concise, and must include details of **exactly** what will happen if your proposal is approved. Policies in the proposal stage will be posted to the mailing list for a minimum of 14 days for active discussion.

TLD applications additionally must include a charter (detailed below).

##### TLD Charters

All TLD applications must include a "charter" detailing their exact policies. At a minimum, it must include the following information.

  - Registration details: How domains will be granted (first-come, first-serve; etc.), how much domains will cost to register ("free" recommended, to not run into problems. You can always offer added services for additional fees.), how long domains will be registered before a renewal will be required, etc.
  - Abuse policies (what are grounds for a domain to be terminated?)
  - Reserved Domains

An example of a TLD charter includes the [.o Charter by ModernTLD](https://github.com/ModernTLD/policy/blob/master/charter.md). Keep in mind it was written with OpenNIC in mind, but is still applicable.

##### Voting

The voting period will last 14 days, after which they will be subject to the following regulation:

  - Policy Proposals: Passes with "50% + 1" of the votes.
  - TLD Proposals: Passes with a 2/3rds supermajority of the votes.

Proposals that failed can be restarted after the voting period ends (it will have to go back to the Proposals stage for further discussion). If your TLD application failed, you should discuss your application with a current TLD Operator before restarting your application.

Policy proposals that pass will go into effect immediately. TLD application proposals that pass will be subject to the Peering stage detailed below before going into effect.

##### Peering (TLD Proposals)

TLD proposals will have to go through a peering process with the alternative roots we peer with (OpenNIC, currently), to ensure they will peer your TLDs both ways. Currently this is handled by Jonah Aragon (of ModernTLD; the operator of `ns11.opennic.glue`) soon after the application is approved here, no intervention on your part will likely be required. Assuming they accept the TLD and relevant policies in the peering agreement, the TLD can go live immediately.

If an alternative root in a peering agreement with us denies acceptance, we will have a private discussion with the applicants regarding concerns they may have. TLD applications cannot be accepted at this time if they wouldn't fall under out 100% peering policy.

### Charter

ModernNIC is a user-owned and user-controlled community service offering an alternative to traditional top-level domain (TLD) registries. Users of our Tier 2 DNS servers can access ModernNIC Namespaces (operated by our TLD operators), [OpenNIC alternative namespaces](http://wiki.opennicproject.org/OpenNICNamespaces), and Legacy ICANN namespaces (.com, .org, etc.).

Our mission is to...

  1. offer free and open access to DNS services by establishing an open, audited network of domain hierarchies external to the existing ICANN and OpenNIC infrastructures.
  2. provide a foundation for further development and experimentation in areas related to DNS and the Internet at large.
  3. encourage the establishment of new top level domains by any capable operators
  4. promote the benefits of alternative root systems that provide global access to uncensored services regardless of any geographical, political, ideological, or economic constraints.

Our organization is structured as two separate forms of governance: firstly, a Board of Directors comprised of our TLD Operators. This branch of control is capable of creating new policies (if all members unanimously agree) and vetoing policies passed by the community (detailed next). Secondly, the Community is operated democratically and is able to pass new policy and TLD proposals (detailed in sections above), veto any Board decisions (with a 2/3rds supermajority veto), or overrule any Board issued vetoes (with a 2/3rds supermajority vote). This series of checks and balances ensures policies can be passed quickly as necessary by the Board, but keeps the scope of the policies in check with strict community oversight.

Membership is available to anybody with an internet connection. There are certain categories of membership specifically designed to keep the community and ModernNIC in check, and ensure no single person can take control of the organization.

  1. **General Members** includes anybody who uses our services. Members can vote on general policies, the creation of new TLDs, and budgeting the organization's resources (monetary, personal expertise, etc.). Any decision made by the other membership categories can appealed by a vote of the general membership.
  2. **DNS Operators** include anyone who operates a ModernNIC DNS server (Tier 2 or Tier 1). Operators are expected to have expertise in DNS and have an interest in how the global infrastructure is maintained and structured. They vote on issues that the general membership cannot be expected to have expertise within. They have the ability to pass policies deemed necessary to further the development of our infrastructure, but proposals can be appealed or vetoed by a vote of the general membership or the Board of Directors. DNS Operators exist as a subset of the general membership and withhold the right to vote as such as well.
  2. **Board Members** include anyone who operates a ModernNIC TLD (Tier 1 server). Board members are expected to have an interest in the development and expansion of ModernNIC and will need to make administrative decisions to further that cause. They vote on issues that the general membership cannot be expected to have a vested interest in, including in-depth organizational decisions. They have the ability to pass proposals deemed necessary to further those goals, but proposals can be appealed by a vote of the general membership. Board Members exist as a subset of both DNS Operators and the general membership, and withhold the right to vote as either in addition to their administrative responsibilities.

### Regarding OpenNIC

##### Why OpenNIC should peer our TLDs

We make every attempt to keep our policies compatible with OpenNIC's ideals. All TLD additions and policy creations are votable discussions and will be held to the highest standards to ensure TLD operators have experience and reliability. We do not currently permit TLDs that do not allow registrations on their namespaces.

**In the event a TLD operator is unable to continue upkeep**, [ModernTLD](https://www.moderntld.com) has volunteered to keep the namespaces operating and registrations open indefinitely. We currently operate `ns11.opennic.glue` and are generally regarded as a reliable member of the OpenNIC community. There should be no worries about the long-term operation of our TLDs.

##### ns11.opennic.glue

`ns11` on OpenNIC operates as a bridge between ModernNIC namespaces and OpenNIC namespaces. It is currently maintained by [ModernTLD](https://www,moderntld.com). Tier 0 operators at OpenNIC should point to ns11 as the authority for peered TLDs, such as ".o", and any future TLDs, regardless of the operator at ModernNIC (unless they express specific interest in operating a Tier 1 OpenNIC server).
